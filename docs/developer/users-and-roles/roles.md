# Roles

The user roles are the main tool for limiting access to the platform's data. By default, the system has the following roles:

* **guest** - given to all non logged users
* **regular** - given to all logged users
* **administrator** - the platform should have at least one administrator. This role is assigned manually and provides full access to the platform.
