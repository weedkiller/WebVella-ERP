# Users

The user accounts in general should not be shared between users. 

You can review the list of the current system's users in the SDK Plugin > Access Users

## Create an user

Currently the only way to create / add a new user is from the SDK Plugin functionality. To do that navigate to the users' list and press the "New User" button.
