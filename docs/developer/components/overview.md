# What is a WebVella ERP Plugin Page Component

The page components are used in the page body generation within the WebVella ERP. They provide the end user with the ability to quickly add, drag and drop, set the options of a certain presentation scenarios

All elements that are rendered within the "generated" page body are part of a page component.

In technical terms they are standard ViewComponents that inherit the `PageComponent` class, have specific attribute, functionality and file structure.

The page components can make their own database requests or use the build in "DataSource / PageModel" data delivery system in the ERP.
