# Overview

An Application in WebVella ERP is the preferred way to target a specific process or selection of processes in a business. In example the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) makes sense to be bundled in one application, while the Project management is in another. This provides a very flexible way to limit the functionality to exactly what is needed for a specific department or even a job position.

From technical perspective, the application is like a lense selecting a specific parts of the platform for presentation like pages or components, which could be dedicated to a single application or shared between many.

All available applications are presented on the platform's home page:
