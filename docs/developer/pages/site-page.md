# Site page

A site page is a general page that is not related to any application. Often used for general information or help. Such pages can be accessed by following routing `/s/{PageName?}`. If you open the url without specifying `PageName`, the system automatically will redirect to the site page with the smallest sort weight.

All site pages are sorted based on their sort weight and presented in a dropdown menu as presented on the next image.
