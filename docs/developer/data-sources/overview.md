# Overview

Datasource is a way to provide data to pages and page components. They can be shared between pages or have different parameters for each page. They are manually added to extend the page DataModel in ordered to be used.

There are two types of datasources - database and code. Code datasources can be added only by Plugins. The main tool for creating database datasources is a custom SQL syntax we call EQL.
